        After finishing my work on the NHS COVID-19 app, I immediately switched
        to helping with the local government response, especially a project with
        Camden Council called Beacon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like all local councils, Camden were overwhelmed with requests to help
        residents who were self-isolating. Interestingly, they were also
        inundated with offers of help from local community and voluntary
        organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem wasn't necessarily a lack of supply. It was just about
        effectively coordinating these needsâ€”matching people in need with
        someone able to help them.
      </p>

        {
          src: "/assets/beacon/2.jpg",
          alt: "Editing and assigning needs",
        },
      ]}
      caption="Managing lists of needs and people with Beacon"
    />

    <TextBlock>
      <p>
        Our research found that the bulk of needs were pretty simple and easily
        met: help with shopping or collecting prescriptions, say. A little bit
        of coordination would take most of these off the table, leaving only the
        most complex cases for the council's statutory services.
      </p>
      <p>Beacon is a tool researched, designed and built to do just that.</p>
      <p>
        I led the early design and software development, taking it from a{" "}
        <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bkMHjnKEbaPq7wiU9">
          sticky note sketch
        </a>{" "}
        to a functional, production-ready piece of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        I facilitated several early workshops with Camden Council stakeholders,
        sketching out UI concepts, user journeys and "how might we" statements.

    <TextBlock>
      <p>
        Because of the speed we needed to deliver at, I chose to build the app
        with Ruby on Rails. I also assessed low-code platforms like Salesforce,
        but the overhead of financing and contracting would have cancelled out
        any saving in development time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool had a lean foundation, essentially functioning as a catalogue
        of residents and their needs, plus a list of organisations able to meet
        them.
      </p>
      <p>Later, we added:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The ability to join needs with the organisation or group responsible
          for meeting it{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          Flows designed to assist contact centre staff checking in with
          vulnerable residents, essentially working as a script for those calls{" "}
        </li>
        <li>Automatic imports of NHS test and trace data</li>
        <li>
          Visual overhauls that made it quicker to perform common actions (fig.
          1-2)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As the project advanced through discovery, alpha and beta, I was joined
        by more developers and designers, so I handed over some responsibilities
        and specialised in the overall technical architecture and design
        language of the product.

        Beacon is still being used by Camden Council and their partners today.
        Turning it into a general-purpose database of resident needs and
        community groups is being considered.
      </p>
      <p>
        The impact of the Beacon project is wider than that single piece of
        software: the design principles and research used to make Beacon were
        also taken and used by other councils and organisations, including on my
        own project, Boost, with Age UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used Beacon as a wedge to encourage a different way of working at
        Camden Council. In the guise of "training" we brought people from
        different departments together and formed new multidisplinary,
        cross-functional teams empowered to solve problems faster, with agility
        that was rare before the pandemic.
