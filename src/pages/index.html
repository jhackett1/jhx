                <p>
                    I spent several weeks at the start of the pandemic on-site at the NHSX
                    offices in Elephant and Castle, figuring out how to turn a vague brief
                    about "digital contact tracing" into reality.

                <p>
                    The now-familiar principles of anonymous Bluetooth contact tracing were
                    entirely new back in February 2020. There were no working
                    implementations to look at. The native Apple and Google APIs

                    for this functionality were still six months away. I had to do
                    everything for the first time.

                    I'm building a new collaborative suite of tools for social workers at
                    Hackney Council.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hackney Council suffered a severe cyberattack in 2020, which knocked
                    important case management software offline. We're helping them recover
                    from that, but also aiming to build something much better than what came
                    before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software Hackney was using to run social care had several important
                    limitations. It locked social workers into frustrating, inflexible
                    processes that had to be followed precisely. It also made it difficult
                    for people recieving care to understand what was happening with their
                    case, or to feel like they had a say in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a relic from an older, patriarchal model of running government
                    services.

        <p>I made this website with 11ty, SCSS and a bit of React, and it’s hosted on Netlify. This lovely chunky font
            is Rubik. I’m also quite pleased with the website this replaced, which you can <a
