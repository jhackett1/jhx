                <p>
                    I spent several weeks at the start of the pandemic on-site at the NHSX
                    offices in Elephant and Castle, figuring out how to turn a vague brief
                    about "digital contact tracing" into reality.

                <p>
                    The now-familiar principles of anonymous Bluetooth contact tracing were
                    entirely new back in February 2020. There were no working
                    implementations to look at. The native Apple and Google APIs

                    for this functionality were still six months away. I had to do
                    everything for the first time.

                    I'm building a new collaborative suite of tools for social workers at
                    Hackney Council.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hackney Council suffered a severe cyberattack in 2020, which knocked
                    important case management software offline. We're helping them recover
                    from that, but also aiming to build something much better than what came
                    before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software Hackney was using to run social care had several important
                    limitations. It locked social workers into frustrating, inflexible
                    processes that had to be followed precisely. It also made it difficult
                    for people recieving care to understand what was happening with their
                    case, or to feel like they had a say in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a relic from an older, patriarchal model of running government
                    services.

                <p>
                    After finishing my work on the NHS COVID-19 app, I immediately switched
                    to helping with the local government response, especially a project with
                    Camden Council called Beacon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like all local councils, Camden were overwhelmed with requests to help
                    residents who were self-isolating. Interestingly, they were also
                    inundated with offers of help from local community and voluntary
                    organisations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem wasn't necessarily a lack of supply. It was just about
                    effectively coordinating these needs—matching people in need with
                    someone able to help them.

                        and build a tool</a> to coordinate
                    local volunteer support for older people.</p>
                <p>Boost allows volunteers to claim tasks from a list that can be organised by urgency or
                    proximity, and submit receipts for reimbursement.
                </p>
                <p>Coordinating volunteers can see which tasks have been done and which are pending.</p>
                <p>The tool, a web app built with Rails, was successfully piloted in late 2020.</p>

                <p>I connected the tool with national data sources from Ofsted,

                <p>The directory emphasises location-based search to

                    makes it easy for users to log in and maintain their own listings, freeing up council time and
